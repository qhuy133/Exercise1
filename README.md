# Ex1

Step 1: use "cd part1" then "npm install" in terminal to go to part1 and install all dependencies
Step 2: use "npm run test" to run test case

- Part 1:

* Step 1: Using map() to create an array that contains length of each element in array
* Step 2: Using reduce() to initializes an object, the key is the length of each string in the beginning of the array, if that key already exitst, plus 1 to that key, else initializes another key plus 1 to that.
* Step 3: use Math.max to find the largest value of Object that was initialized in step 2
* Step 4: Using find() to find the key that is the most frequently in Object
* Step 5: Using filter() for orginal array to filter elements that has length are equal to key was found in step 4 and we get the result of the problem

- Part 2:

* Step 1: Using sort() to create an array that was sorted in descending and the first 2 elements of array are the 2 largest elements
* Step 2: Add the first 2 elements of the array and we get the result of the problem
